        I am a Brooklyn transplant, originally from Lenoir, NC. I moved to the city for college, hated city life (because I was living in the financial district), then fell in love with New York and never moved back.
        I became a teacher after graduating, and am grateful for the opportunities I was given to work alongside inspiring teachers as well as to work the kindest group of students in the city. I joined General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program in hopes of changing career paths to something with better work-life balance, only to find that coding was an end enjoyable in itself. 
        Now I am searching for a new role where I can expand my knowledge of code! Leave me a message below if you have any opportunities or inquiries.
